<p class="textalign ">This REU Supplement with allow Dr. Parikh to recruit two undergraduate ISE students and provide them with vital research experience in using data analytics and optimization methods in trauma care. The students will help cleanse and organize data we have received from the States of OH and IN, analyze them using appropriate statistical tools, and help the current graduate students in model validation and evaluation studies, and GIS tool development.

<p class="textalign ">Trauma is a leading cause of death in younger populations. The trauma care network should ensure that severely injured patients receive the right care in the right amount of time, but maldistribution of trauma care facilities can result in under-treatment of severely injured patients as well as expensive over-treatment of less-severely injured patients. This project will facilitate coordinated network design between state agencies and hospital networks, two key stakeholders in the trauma care system. Innovative optimization methods to coordinate the bilevel decision making process for trauma center location will be developed. This will enable trauma policy makers to quantitatively benchmark trauma care regionally and nationally in terms of triage errors and costs. Our collaborators include practicing trauma surgeons from Johns Hopkins University and WSU, EMS chief, and EMS/Trauma Divisions at the State of OH and IN.

<p class="textalign ">The multidisciplinary research team consisting of academics (engineering, psychology, and computer science) and two industry personnel proposes moving visual experience of a three dimensional environment from the realm of intuition and experience to analytical science. The specific focus of this grant will be on developing a general set of analytical models that emerge from the analysis of a variety of context-specific human-environment interactions (e.g., nurse in CCU, shopper in a retail store). With a solid grounding in the basic psychology of Perception-Action, the analytical models will integrate three-dimensional spatial relationships with the human eye’s field of vision and the physical attributes of a human. Most significantly, the research will consider complex dynamics resulting from human movement in the space, with all the attendant changes in visual angles, and the appearance and disappearance of visual obstacles. Human performance will be empirically examined in a Virtual Environment in order to validate the proposed analytical metrics of visual experience.

<p class="textalign">Through this research grant, our academic-industry team intends to offer insights into improving patient flow through inpatient units and efficiently managing staff workload. We propose to study the inpatient discharge planning problem, i.e., optimally organizing and managing discharge processes to minimize inpatient admission and discharge delay. We provide an approach to tradeoff competing issues of upstream patient boarding, inpatient discharge lateness, and inpatient unit workload integration. We incorporate various sources of uncertainties arising in discharge service processing time, wait time between consecutive services, and arrival time of inpatient bed request. Our approach will serve as a benchmark for existing ad hoc rules while developing new near-optimal and implementable discharge policies. This research will allow hospital managers to increase patient satisfaction and service throughput, policy makers to develop improved benchmarks for hospital workflows, and front-line providers to make intelligent data-driven decisions.

<p class="textalign">Our academic-industry team proposes to develop a set of innovative models and solutions for analyzing the three-way interaction among warehousing, inventory, and transportation decisions. For this purpose, we introduce for the first time in academic literature the warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP) for multi-echelon and multi-period supply chains. Decisions associated with products with differing life-cycles flowing through the supply chain are also considered in the WITP. This project is very unique as it will develop managerial insights on the the impact of tactical and operational warehousing decisions in generating supply chain plans.

<p class="textalign ">The VA initiated electronic consults (e-consults) to provide specialty consults to veterans throughout the U.S. The overall goals were to improve access, communication and coordination of care for veterans to health care providers. Intended outcomes of e-consults are to increase access to specialty care in rural and underserved settings, reduce wait times, reduce fee and travel costs, improve Veteran and staff satisfaction, increase provider knowledge, competencies and professional training hours, and maintain or improve patient safety. This study documented the diabetes, GI, and neurosurgery e-consult process by using chart reviews, job shadowing, and interviews, and statistical and simulation modeling, to identify potential risks and barriers during each step in the e-consult process.</p>
